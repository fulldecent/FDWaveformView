# Recommendations for Additional Work

Based on the open issues in this repository, here are some recommended improvements that could be implemented:

## High Priority Issues

### Issue #157: Example app functionality issues
- The example project toggles don't work in simulator
- Zooming in/out doesn't function properly
- Needs investigation and fixes to ensure examples work correctly

### Issue #156: visionOS Support
- `tracks(withMediaType:)` is unavailable in visionOS
- Consider adding conditional compilation for visionOS platform
- Alternative: Use newer AVFoundation APIs that work across platforms

### Issue #148: âœ… COMPLETED - Updated README examples
- Fixed outdated API usage in README examples
- Changed `progressSamples` to `highlightedSamples`
- Changed `zoomStartSamples`/`zoomEndSamples` to `zoomSamples` range

## Medium Priority Enhancements

### Issue #146: Separate rendering from display
- Consider architectural changes to separate rendering logic from UI
- Could improve performance and enable server-side rendering
- Reference competitor: DSWaveformImage library
- Would enable gradient and "lo-fi" bar rendering styles

### Issue #139: View and data provider separation
- Define protocol for data sources beyond AVAsset
- Remove AVFoundation dependency from core view logic
- Enable custom data sources (e.g., generated sine waves, network streams)
- Substantial architectural change but would improve flexibility

### Issue #130: Audio playback integration examples
- Currently blocked on Issue #139
- Need clear examples of connecting waveform progress to audio playback
- Would greatly improve developer experience

## Lower Priority Issues

### Issue #153: Custom wave styling
- User wants custom waveform shapes/styles
- Could be addressed as part of the rendering separation work

### Issue #104: Prevent scrolling past audio end
- Add option to keep waveform end at right edge when zoomed
- Relatively simple UX improvement

### Issue #96: Consider UIScrollView subclassing
- Would add scroll-past-ends, bouncing, acceleration
- API non-breaking change that adds many gesture features

### Issue #93: Zoom crash protection
- Add maximum zoom limits to prevent crashes
- Simple safety feature with hardcoded limits

### Issue #2: Incremental rendering
- Update view progressively for large files instead of all-at-once
- Performance improvement for large audio files

## Implementation Priority Recommendations

1. **Fix Example App (Issue #157)** - Critical for developer onboarding
2. **Add visionOS Support (Issue #156)** - Platform compatibility
3. **Audio Integration Examples (Issue #130)** - After Issue #139 resolution
4. **Zoom Safety (Issue #93)** - Simple safety improvement
5. **Scroll Behavior (Issue #104)** - UX improvement
6. **Architectural Refactoring (Issues #139, #146)** - Long-term improvements

The GitHub Actions setup and test improvements completed in this PR provide a solid foundation for implementing these enhancements with confidence.
